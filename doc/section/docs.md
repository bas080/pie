# Documentation

In case you want to contribute to the documentation, you can edit one of the
sections in the `./doc` folder. The generating of the `./README.md` can be done
by the maintainer.

Generating of the `./README.md` is done using
[mash](https://github.com/bas080/Mash)

Run `npm run docs` to generate the `./README.md`.
