## Jane and John

> Once upon a time

```js
require ./src/jane-and-john-users.js
```

Jane and John are having a day out in the city. John sees a bike he would like
to buy, but he forgot his credited. He doesn't have enough cash to pay for
the bike. He asks Jane if she can help him by paying for it now. He promises her to
pay her back as soon as he gets home. Jane agrees to pay for the bike.

```js
require ./src/jane-and-john-bike.js
```

John is a very happy man but he does owe Jane 100 euros. After some walking
they are both thirsty and would like to have a drink. They find a place,
sit down and order two tap water and two coffee. Jane is also peckish and orders
a slice of cake. As a token of good will John pays for the drinks and cake.
They agree that they'll split it later.

```js
require ./src/jane-and-john-cafe.js
```

After an eventful day they decide to go home. They say goodbye and agree that
Jane will do the bill splitting. She gets home and opens up her favorite
terminal with a bash command line.

```bash
cd ~/fun/
git clone git@github.com:bas080/pie.git
```

She has defined all the transactions and users and now only has to get the
result.

```js
require ./src/jane-and-john-result.js
```

She runs this code using some bash commands for a nice result.

```bash
require ./doc/script/jane-and-john.sh
```

```md
require ./doc/output/jane-and-john.md
```
